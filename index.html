          The following types of timelines can be set via animation-timeline:
        </h3>
        <p>
          The default document timeline, which is progressed through by the
          passing of time since the document was first loaded in the browser.
          This is the timeline traditionally associated with CSS animations and
          is selected with a value of auto, or by not specifying an
          animation-timeline value at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          A scroll progress timeline, which is progressed through by scrolling a
          scrollable element (scroller) between top and bottom (or left and
          right). The position in the scroll range is converted into a
          percentage of progress — 0% at the start and 100% at the end. The
          element that provides the scroll progress timeline can be specified in
          two ways:
